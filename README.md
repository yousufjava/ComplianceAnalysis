This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of AI implementation across the Big 4 accounting firms (EY, PwC, Deloitte, KPMG) and its impact on auditing practices. The project combines data analysis, visualization, and strategic insights to understand how AI is transforming the auditing landscape.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yousufjava/ComplianceAnalysis.git
cd ComplianceAnalysis
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Dashboard
1. Start the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py

2. Open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

The dashboard will display interactive visualizations of the Big 4 firms' AI implementation metrics, workload impacts, and fraud detection statistics.

### Running the Analysis Notebook
